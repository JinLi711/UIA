The food looked good, though I didn't have anything. And the staff was quite friendly. I don't live close, but if I did, it's the kind of place that I would frequent. However, if I did frequent Kusanya, it would be, without exception, with newspaper, magazine, or book in hand. Here's the negative:Normally in 2018, non-working wifi (unless it is a one-time, unforeseeable disruption, as can happen to any business) knocks a review down to one star. But these guys are a non-profit and doing good work, so there's no need to ding them. Not for nothing, but they also have no reviews less than three stars, which is definitely something. Still, after a twenty-mile or so, meandering bike ride through some nasty, nasty construction zones and streets (screw you, Hyde Park!!!) with Kusanya as the ultimate goal, I can't say it didn't leave a bad taste when, after changing out of my sweat-soaked jersey, ordering a drink, settling in, and opening my laptop, I was treated to internet that wouldn't connect.

I had the baked oatmeal with fresh berries and almond milk and it was perfect, along with a latte. Prices are so so extremely reasonable, and the bakery case has yummy items ranging from 90 cents to three bucks. I love the aesthetic here. They have beautiful art pieces and a rustic, hip feel to the general decor. The coffee is roasted and packaged on-site and also sold at the Englewood Whole Foods. Everything is top notch quality with choices of $1 mugs of coffee if you order it to stay. I love the nods to Englewood throughout the cafe, from the outline of the neighborhood sketched on tables, to the coffee sleeves and paper bags. Kusanya also hosts neighborhood events, a fresh foods night market on certain evenings, yoga on weekends, and open mic storytelling. Kusanya is also a non-profit that started on Kickstarter and that stays afloat through community support and grants. If you want to donate check them out online or stop by and ask about it.

A very friendly ice breaker option.  Of course I waited for the next person to pay them forward $2 as well.  I chose a hearty bowl of corn chowder because I was starving so I will have to check out the lattes next time I visit.  I told a friend that one of the sandwich options is a ""Tuna Turner.""  He laughed and suggested that they should offer an ""Ike Tea"" to go with it.Nice place.  Nice people.  Happy to have a landing place when I'm visiting Englewood.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_8m83yHAwFouMIkOLMzvGA/348s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kusanya-cafe-chicago?reviewid=EtucMc2Vh9nQcBEQzcS-Vg&select=_8m83yHAwFouMIkOLMzvGA,14 people voted for this review,,,Useful,10,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.
