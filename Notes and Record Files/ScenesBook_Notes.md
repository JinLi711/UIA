# Chapter 1: Setting the Scene

## “Scene” as the Aesthetic View of Place (page 8)

  * Definition of Scenes:
   >  "There are people doing many things, sitting in a cafe, entering and exiting a grocery, milling about after a church service, cheering the home team. Then ask what style of life, spirit, meaning, mood, is expressed in all of this. Is it dangerous or exotic, familial or avant-garde? How could others share in that spirit, experience and embrace its meaning sympathetically, or reject it? What, in other words, is in the character of this particular place that links to broader and more universal themes?" (page 8)
   > "the aesthetic meaning of a place" (page 8)

  * Scenes can enhance the technology of locations. Check out Figure 1.4 on page 26.


# Chapter 2: Theory of Scenes

  * Objective:
   > "what caused something to be the way it is or what other things it makes happen. That is, we want an account of why this type of scene came into being here and now, and of what tends to happen if it is there." (page 29).

  * Culture:
   > "On one end, “culture” suggests a single, totalizing, delimited set of values that define a whole people or civilization" (page 30)
   > "On the other end of the spectrum is a tendency toward a strong particularism." (page 30)
   > "The question then becomes, How, when, where, and why do particular people gather around particular sets of cultural tastes and activities, to what extent do these tastes and activities both differentiate people by and build bridges across various social categories (like income, race, and religion), and how does the way they do so vary by place and time?" (page 30)

  * Three Analytical Components of Scenes (check out Table 2.1 on page 36):
   1. Theatricality
     > "Theatricality is about performance, and there is a certain logic of performance, not of specificity to generality but rather external to internal and convention to deviance. There is first the conspicuous display of self as an object to be viewed for the sake of being viewed: the exhibitionism of “look at me!”" (38)
       1. Glamour:
         > " Glamorous scenes place one in the presence of dazzling, shimmering, mysterious but seductive personae, perfectly fashioned, like me but more than me." (40)
       2. Neighborliness
         > "Warm, caring members of a community joined with friends and fellows in camaraderie—this is the ideal of neighborliness." (40)
       3. Transgression
         > "Transgression breaks conventional styles of appearance, shattering normal expectations for proper comportment, dress, and manners, outraging mainstream sensibilities" (41)
       4. Formality
         > "Formal scenes prize highly ritualized, often ceremonial standards of dress, speech, and appearance." (41)
       5. Exhibitionism
         > "Exhibitionism makes private aspects of the self highly visible publically" (41)
   2. Authenticity
     > "Authenticity says something about the sources of your being, where the “true you” comes from." (38)
       1. Locality
         > "Locality highlights being from here, being rooted in this place and this place only, untainted by alien customs." (42)
       2. Ethnicity
         > "ethnic customs suggest deep, unchosen, originary practices, somehow resistant to and undiluted by a homogenizing, deracinated, abstract global monoculture" (43)
       3. State
       4. Corporateness
       5. Rationality
   3. Legitimacy
     > " Legitimacy concerns the basis of moral judgments, the authority on which a verdict of right or wrong is grounded" (39)
       1. Tradition
         > "Tradition connects us to a past the weight of which informs our reasons for acting in the here and now" (45)
       2. Charisma
         > " Charisma creates legitimacy through the extraordinary qualities and accomplishments of great figures. Charisma connects us to magnetically compelling heroes, enjoining us to follow them, regardless of established rules and historic conventions." (46)
       3. Utilitarianism
         > " Utilitarian legitimacy hews not to tradition or prophets but to Profit." (47)
       4. Egalitarianism
         > "That legitimacy depends on respecting human equality stands at the core of egalitarianism. All people, close or far, high or low, deserve fair and equal treatment" (47)
       5. Self-Expression
         > "Self-expression bases legitimacy in the actualization of an individual personality. The good person is one who brings her own unique take, her own personal style, her own way of seeing, to each and every one of her actions." (47)

# Chapter 3: Quantitative Flânerie

  * BIZZIP
    Zip Code Business Patterns created by the census bureau (61)
    > "in addition to all sorts of for-profit businesses from fruit markets to graphic design firms, it also includes information about nonprofit and government organizations, like art museums, religious organizations, human rights organizations, civic and social organizations, and more." (61)
  * Yellow Pages
    > "They are collected and organized with consumers rather than bureaucrats in mind, so they often provide more specific information about qualitative experiential differences across organizations" (61)

  * Take a look at amenities table 3.1 (65) Kurtosis table 3.3 (70)

# Chapter 5: Home, Home on the Scene How Scenes Shape Residential Patterns

> "Different people are drawn to different scenes. The character of the scene plays a major role in determining who lives where and therefore what shape residential communities take. To be sure, more than amenities define the opportunities and attractions that places afford to current and potential residents." (132)

> "A first question asks which types of scenes attract which types of people. We find links between scenes and population changes across many subgroups: young people tend to increase in transgressive scenes, baby boomers are rising where self-expression and local authenticity mix, and retirees are increasing both near natural amenities and in places rich in the arts." (133)

> "how scenes distinguish within and transcend powerful social cleavages, like race, religion, and education" (133)

> "Contemporary research has thus turned to local amenities and their potential role in changing the trajectory of black neighborhoods. Schools, daycare, churches, and community centers often feature prominently. Ethnographic studies suggest that such amenities can play key roles in establishing a circuit of neighborhood relationships that encourage mutual support, information sharing, and respect." (140)

  * In which types of scenes do which types of people live?
    * Age Groups
     > "The general idea is that with their youth they bring energy, vitality, openness to and tolerance of new ideas, and a kind of comfort with the growing diversity that increasingly characterizes American life." (144)
     > "Figures 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5 show proportions of young people, baby boomers, and retirees, as well as their changes." (149)
    * Artists
    > "Artists are drawn to urban, inner-city neighborhoods with cheap rents and an air of risk, marginality, and diversity, often linked to crime and nonwhite persons. As artists work their magic, the neighborhood grows more attractive." (151)

  * "we would expect certain types of amenities to have relatively narrow geographic and demographic reach and to thus be relatively strongly correlated with educational and racial residential concentrations." (157)

  * Churches
   > "membership and participation in mainline churches has declined. By contrast, conservative evangelical Christianity has been ascendant." (158)
   >"Perhaps the central feature of the new spiritual awakening was a rejection of authority and a concomitant turn to the self." (161)

  * "Table 5.1. New Con and Pop Culture are the most numerous and broadly distributed organizations; New Age has the fewest organizations and most concentrated distribution" (169) Also, check out: Figure 5.9 (173)

# Chapter 6: Scene Power How Scenes Influence Voting, Energize New Social Movements, and Generate Political Resources

  > "Scenes grow more politically salient in general with (1) the rise of culture, (2) the rediscovery of the urbane, and (3) the new political culture." (177)

  > "From 1996 to 2012, Democratic votes were correlated with more urbane dimensions like transgression and self-expression; Republican votes, with more communitarian dimensions, like neighborliness and tradition." (178)

  > "Scenes provide cues about the character of a place, which some people find welcoming and others find alien and strange, sorting themselves accordingly. (182)

  > "The new political culture redefines these issues of quality, culture, and place in political terms, by emphasizing how nascent leaders and social movements champion specific lifestyle issues and consumption concerns. " (183)

  > " scenes become political opportunities for ambitious leaders and objects of contestation among citizens." (183)

  > " In the process, the excitement and energy projected by the scene—its buzz—becomes a valuable resource that may affect and redefine other valuable resources, such as money, political support, and votes. “Buzz” refers to the symbols and signals circulating around a scene, the message that something is happening here." (184)

  > " support from influential neighborhood leaders can enhance solidarity among residents who are in turn more likely to treat the scene’s buzz as a neighborhood asset" (184)

  > " emotional engagement generated by artists and other experts in the ways of buzz encourages average citizens to spend time and money to energize the scene and build a political base for its supporters." (185)

  > "Some scenes may exhibit expansionary policies, to extend buzz far and wide with few strings attached (as in “low commitment” pop music or club districts). " (186)

  > "When themes like egalitarianism and anticorporatism are shared across multiple scenes, they are more likely to grow into a broader social movement. " (187)

  > "there is an affinity between (1) certain types of political organizations (e.g., environmental groups, social justice advocates, human rights champions) and (2) certain sorts of scenes (e.g., those that support values such as creativity, experimentation, and cosmopolitanism). The success of the first, often termed new social movements (NSMs), may thus depend on their location amid the second." (192)

  > "Where do NSMs thrive? They are usually present in high rent, high crime counties, and there are more of them in Democratic counties. Neighborhoods with any (and many) NSMs are usually in dense, lower rent zip codes with strong cultural employment concentrations, nonwhite residents, and college graduates." (198)

  > " Zip codes whose walkability is high (i.e., one standard deviation higher than average) have in our model about 60 percent more NSMs than zip codes with average walkability, when controlling for our other variables." (200)

  > "when walking and self-expression come together, the result is quite likely to be organizations advocating for human rights, social justice, and the environment." (202)

  > " self-expressive scene, for instance, likely indicates a broadly culturally liberal environment" (206)

# Chapter 8: The Science of Scenes

> "our main data, local amenities, are not constitutive of scenes but, through the science of scenes, become useful indicators of the qualities that constitute scenes." (251)

  * Ideal Scene:
   > "the data should be geographically comprehensive" (257)

   > "the data should possess a high degree of spatial resolution" (257)
   
   > "the data should differentiate amenities as much as possible." (257)

   > "an amenity should ideally be spatially invariant in its potential availability and typical practices" (258)
   
   > "the data should permit analysis of trends over time" (258)
